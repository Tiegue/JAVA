Product: "BTC" - A Simple Freehand Drawing Software especially for Kids, Designed for Mouse Use.

Function Overview:
1.Canvas featuring scalable X and Y axes, a center-cross line, and real-time display of mouse position.
2.Resize the canvas by dragging its bottom-right corner.
3.Introduce a user-friendly control bar on the left side of the window, housing a color selection panel with an adjustable color block for your preferred choice, accompanied by an indicator of the current color.
4.Effortlessly sketch lines, triangles, rectangles, ovals, arcs, and any type of polygon.
5.Grant flexibility to adjust the size and color of all shapes at will.
6.Simplify deletion by dragging a shape out of the canvas.
7.Utilize a slider to conveniently determine linewidths and angles for arc shapes.
8.Instantly view drawing details as they appear in a real-time text area.
9.Implement an automatic save feature, preserving your work in a personalized "shapes.BTC" file every 5 minutes only when changes occured within last 5 minutes.
10.Seamlessly load your creations from the "shapes.BTC" file each time the software is launched.

Design Approach:
1.Five shape classes have been created to represent five types of shapes. These classes implement both the Shapes interface and the Serializable class in Java.
2.A global perspective is crucial, such as designing global view variables. Multiple mouse events often use the same global variables.

Key Technical Extensions:
1.Utilizing file and object handling for loading and saving: FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, ObjectInputStream, ObjectOutputStream.
2.Implementation of Timer and LocalDate for automatic saving every 5 minutes and tracking the saved file's timestamp.

References:
1.Book: "Core Java Volume I - Fundamentals."
2.Insights from chatGpt, including searching for Windows quit event, Timer function, and grammar/spelling checks in English.
3.Regarding Group Work: We collaboratively discussed the project's outline and essential details. Later, we coded individually and learned from one another.

Acknowledgments:
1.Immense gratitude to all staff, especially Ali and Kaorta, for their invaluable assistance.
2.Special thanks to my group members, yuyu and morgan.

Regrets:
Although the rotation function was developed, there might be slight parameter errors. Hence, I temporarily removed it from the function. I plan to fine-tune the rotation function during my leisure time.

Hope:
I am hopeful that the "BTC" product will bring joy to my little son.

Wishing everyone a wonderful holiday.
